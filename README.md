## Data Origin

This datafile was created using a series of API requests with the R package `omdbapi`, which allows users to obtain IMDb data.

## Repo Description

This repo has two files: one is the `MoviesData.Rmd` file containing code for the API requests, and the other file is the `movie_data.csv` file containing the results of the requests: the actual data.
